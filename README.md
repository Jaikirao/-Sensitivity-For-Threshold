# -Sensitivity-For-Threshold
In this first project, I want you to calculate the sensitivty for the "threshold" function.  First compute the sum over the database (i.e. sum(db)) and return whether that sum is greater than a certain threshold. Then, I want you to create databases of size 10 and threshold of 5 and calculate the sensitivity of the function. Finally, re-initialize the database 10 times and calculate the sensitivity each time.
